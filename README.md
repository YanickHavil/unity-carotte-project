# unity-carotte-project
Projet unity perso

First serious project with unity

Ambitious project of a God-like game created alone, the player must survive in the world by influecing creature to his side and build a base. Player must feed his creature and they can evolve.

Lots of work with IA and behavior to have a stabilised ecosystem that can be destroy or preserve by the player 

Inspired by Rimworld, Dwarf fortress and other survival-like game
Inspired by Pokemon, Black & White for the system of creature to maintain.


I made this prototype to form me to the development in unity 2D/3D and was too ambitious to finish it alone so I abandonned it for
now
